Based on the user's request, please generate a detailed system requirement specification.

Here is an example of a good response for a similar request.

### EXAMPLE

#### User's Request
Add OAuth2 login with Google.

#### Generated Requirement Specification

##### Current Status
The application currently uses a simple username/password authentication system. There is no integration with third-party identity providers.

##### Desired Status
The application will support user authentication via Google's OAuth2 protocol. Users should be able to log in or sign up with their Google account with a single click.

##### Functional Requirements
- **FR1:** A "Login with Google" button shall be present on the login and registration pages.
- **FR2:** Clicking the button shall redirect the user to Google's authentication page.
- **FR3:** After successful authentication with Google, the user shall be redirected back to the application.
- **FR4:** If the user is new, a new user account shall be created in our system using their Google profile information (name, email).
- **FR5:** If the user already exists (matched by email), they shall be logged into their existing account.
- **FR6:** The user's session should be managed by the application after a successful login.

##### Non-functional Requirements
- **NFR1:** The OAuth2 flow must be secure, using HTTPS for all redirects.
- **NFR2:** The application must securely store client IDs and secrets.
- **NFR3:** The login process should not take more than 3 seconds (excluding user time on Google's page).

##### Acceptance Criteria
- **AC1:** A user can click the "Login with Google" button and successfully log in.
- **AC2:** A new user can sign up using their Google account, and their account is created in the database.
- **AC3:** An existing user can log in with Google and is correctly associated with their existing account.
- **AC4:** If a user denies permission on the Google consent screen, they are gracefully returned to the login page with an appropriate message.

##### Out of Scope
- Support for other OAuth providers (e.g., Facebook, GitHub).
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) for Google logins.
- Linking an existing username/password account to a Google account.

##### Questions to the user
- What specific user information (scopes) should we request from Google (e.g., profile, email)?
- What should be the redirect URL after a successful login?
- Are there any specific error handling requirements for failed login attempts?
